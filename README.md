# GhostScript
This is the home of the GhostScript language!

# About
GhostScript is a free, open-source programming language designed to simplify your scripting experience and handle the hard parts for you.<br>
Ghost offers an expansive pre-proccessor system to deal with dependencies before the script is executed.<br>
Ghost also includes the Autodebugger API, Context Awareness API and Ghost Assistant API.<br>
The Autodebugger API uses an AI-powered model to analyze your script to solve errors and include documentation.<br>
The Context Awareness API uses a mix of JavaScript and AI to figure out "what you meant".<br>
The Ghost Assistant API uses an AI-powered model to help you with development within Ghost - be it learning, scripting or anything else you might need.
